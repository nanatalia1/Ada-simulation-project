Ada Simulation Procect
Project developed for Programming Languages course during undergraduate computer science studies. It presents a simulation of a bakery containing tasks, producers, customers, and a buffer. The main aim of the project was to solve jamming problems.

To solve given problems and provide a consistent simulation synchronization mechanism were implemented, such as selective accept, timed entry call, and conditional entry call.
